Home of the MacGooey Mono Repo.

MacGooey is a collection of components that can be used to quickly build a
consistently themed application using reusable components. By extracting
components that solve consistent problems across our suite of applications,
we can prevent doubling up on components.

### Storybook

Coming soon...


### Usage

Run `npm i -S @macgyver-team/macgooey` and then you can import components and
use them in your applications.

```javascript
import { Button } from "@macgyver-team/macgooey";

const MyButton = () => <Button>My Button</Button>;
```

### Contributing

1. Start by cloning this repository into a folder on your computer.
2. Install node modules by running `npm i` at the project root and in the
directory `packages/macgooey`.
3. In the `packages/macgooey` directory, run `npm run watch` to compile and
watch the source files for the UI (Any changes to make to the files under
`packages/macgooey/src` will now cause the files to be rebuilt/recompiled
automatically). Hot reloading will be reflected in the storybook.
4. In the root directory, run `npm run storybook`. This will start the
storybook on port 9002 (by default), which will load any "stories" that are
configured in the `stories` directory.
5. Open a web browser to http://localhost:9002.
6. Change files in the `packages/macgooey/src` directory and see your changes
appear automatically.
